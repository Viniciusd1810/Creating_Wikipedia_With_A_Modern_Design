            <p>Super Mario (スーパーマリオ, Sūpā Mario) is a series of platform video games created by Nintendo, based on and starring the fictional plumber Mario. Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros. series (スーパーマリオブラザーズ, Sūpā Mario Burazāzu) or simply the Mario series (マリオ), it is the main series of the larger Mario franchise.</p>
            <p>The Super Mario series games are usually set in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom, with Mario as the playable character. He is often accompanied by his brother, Luigi, and occasionally by other members of the Mario cast.</p>
            <p>The Super Mario series is part of the larger Mario franchise, which includes other game genres and media such as films, television, print media, and merchandise. More than 380 million copies of Super Mario titles have been sold worldwide, making it the fourth best-selling video game series.</p>
            
            <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
            <p>Super Mario Bros., the first side-scrolling 2D platform game featuring Mario, was derived from the collaboration of Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, both from Nintendo, as a successor to the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros., which starred two characters: Mario, the main character who first appeared in Donkey Kong as the original playable character and in its sequel where he was the final boss, and Luigi, who first appeared in Mario Bros. The etymology of adding "Super" to the title came after the decision to integrate the Super Mushroom into the game. Super Mario Bros. was released in 1985 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It established many of the core gameplay concepts of the Mario franchise. The Mario brothers, Mario and Luigi, must rescue Princess Toadstool (later called Princess Peach) from Bowser in the Mushroom Kingdom. The game consists of eight worlds with four stages each, totaling 32 stages. Although the worlds differ in themes, the fourth stage is always a fortress or castle ending with a battle against Bowser (or one of his minions disguised as him). This is one of the best-selling games of all time.</p>
            
            <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
            <p>As a platform game, the player can run and jump across platforms and over enemies in themed stages. The games feature simple plots, usually with Mario rescuing Princess Peach, who has been kidnapped by the main antagonist, Bowser. The first game in the series, Super Mario Bros., released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established the core gameplay concepts and elements of the franchise. This includes a variety of power-ups and items that give Mario special abilities, such as throwing fireballs and changing size.</p>
