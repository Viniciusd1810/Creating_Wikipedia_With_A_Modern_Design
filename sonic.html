            <h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
            <p>Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform video game franchise created by Yuji Naka and Naoto Oshima of Sega's Sonic Team, currently overseen by Takashi Iizuka. The first game in the Sonic series, released in 1991, was developed by Sega's Sonic Team following a request for a new mascot. The title was a success and led to several sequels, propelling Sega to the forefront of the video game console market during the 16-bit era from the early to mid-90s. Today, it is one of the most famous and profitable franchises in the video game industry. The franchise is centered around Sonic the Hedgehog, who, along with his friends like the fox Tails and the echidna Knuckles, must stop the world domination plans of the villain Dr. Eggman.</p>
            
            <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
            <p>Almost all games in the series feature a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic as the main player character and protagonist. The games detail Sonic and his allies' attempts to save the world from various threats, primarily the evil genius Dr. Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik, the series' main antagonist. Robotnik's main goal is to take over the world; to achieve this, he usually tries to eliminate Sonic and acquire the powerful Chaos Emeralds.</p>
            <p>While the early games in the series were side-scrolling platformers, later titles expanded into various other genres and sub-series, such as the sports game Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games (developed in partnership with Nintendo), the Sonic Boom series, and the racing game Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. As of 2016, the series had sold over 80 million physical copies and more than 350 million units when including re-releases and mobile downloads. Outside of video games, the franchise has also expanded into other media, including cartoons, anime, and a long-running comic book series, which was recognized by the Guinness World Records as the longest-running comic book series based on a video game.</p>

            <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
            <p>In the main series, gameplay is divided into two styles: 2D (typically platforming) and 3D. In 2D gameplay, predominant in Sonic's earlier games, players control Sonic horizontally, jumping on enemies to defeat them. A recurring element is the collection of rings, which serve as a source of energy for Sonic. When a certain number of rings are collected, players can access Special Stages, bonus levels where they can collect 6/7 magical stones called Chaos Emeralds. These emeralds grant Sonic superpowers, transforming him into Super Sonic, who can fly, run faster, and become invincible, only being defeated if he falls into a pit, drowns, or gets crushed between two moving spikes/platforms. If the player collects all the Chaos Emeralds, they are rewarded with the true ending.</p>
            <p>Another recurring gameplay element in classic Sonic games is the item monitors, which grant Sonic various abilities, such as a protective shield or an extra life. The game was also among the first in video game history to introduce save states, allowing players to resume from their last checkpoint upon losing a life. Players have 10 minutes to complete a level; otherwise, they receive a "Time Over" screen. Initially, players have three lives to complete a level, but they can earn more by collecting 100 rings or finding an extra life monitor. Points are earned by defeating enemies, completing levels within a set time, or collecting rings, with each ring adding 100 points. However, Sonic is not invincibleâ€”he can be defeated by being crushed, falling into a pit, drowning (only in water stages, where he can survive using air bubbles), or touching an enemy without rings. If Sonic has a shield, he loses it; if he has rings, he drops them but can recover some; and if he has no rings, he loses a life. When the life counter reaches zero, the game ends unless the player has obtained a continue, which grants three extra lives after collecting 50 rings in a Special Stage or earning 30,000 points.</p>
            <p>Sonic can attack using the Super Sonic Jump, the Super Sonic Spin, which is executed after running at high speed and pressing down, and the Spin Dash, which allows Sonic to charge and roll forward at high speed, destroying obstacles in his path.</p>
            <p>In 3D gameplay, Sonic gains additional special attacks such as the Homing Attack, Light Speed Dash, and Boost. The game world is now open and in 3D, featuring multiple alternate paths and the traditional platforming levels known as Action Stages. There are also Adventure Fields, where players can access levels, interact with NPCs, complete missions, or search for collectibles like medals and emblems that unlock extra content. Players can also find "power-ups" that grant new abilities.</p>
