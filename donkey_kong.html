            <p>Donkey Kong (ドンキーコング, Donkī Kongu) is a video game series by Nintendo, created by Shigeru Miyamoto, revolving around the character Donkey Kong (or Cranky Kong). The character first appeared in the arcade game of the same name in 1981, where he faced Jumpman (Mario), who later went on to star in the first title of his own franchise on the company's consoles, Super Mario Bros. In 1994, the series was revived with the platform game Donkey Kong Country, featuring Donkey Kong and his group of other monkeys as protagonists in the jungle setting of Donkey Kong Island, battling a variety of anthropomorphic enemies, the Kremlings, a clan of crocodiles led by King K. Rool.</p>
            
            <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
            <p>Donkey Kong was the first example of a platform-style game. Sometimes characterized as the first platformer in history, it was actually the first game to use jumping as a mechanic, introducing the need to jump across gaps, obstacles, and nearby enemies. The game helped define the platforming genre.</p>
            <p>To win the game, the player had to reach Pauline (who had been kidnapped by Donkey Kong), earning points. Points could also be acquired in other ways, such as destroying obstacles or even jumping over them. Every 10,000 points granted the player an extra life.</p>
            <p>In 1982, Universal Studios sued Nintendo, claiming that Donkey Kong was too similar to King Kong, without realizing that King Kong had already entered the public domain. This was considered one of the biggest missteps in video game history.</p>
            
            <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Games in the franchise typically follow the platforming genre, except for some titles like Donkey Konga and Diddy Kong Racing. The origin of the name "Donkey Kong" varies. Some rumors suggest a miscommunication altered the original name of the series, while others say that Miyamoto was looking for an English word meaning "silly" or "stubborn" and came across "Donkey," which means "burro." Miyamoto later confirmed that the name was intended to mean "stupid" or "stubborn."</p>
