            <p>Bomberman (ボンバーマン, Bonbāman, also briefly known as Dyna Blaster in Europe) is a video game franchise created by Shinichi Nakamoto and Shigeki Fujiwara, originally developed by Hudson Soft and currently owned by Konami. The original game, also known as Bakudan Otoko (爆弾男, "Bomb Man"), was released in Japan in July 1983 and has since spawned multiple sequels and spin-offs released on numerous platforms, as well as several anime and manga adaptations..</p>
            <p>As of 2023, the series has sold approximately 16 million physical copies, and 7.2 million paid mobile downloads for a total of 23.2 million.</p>
            
            <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
            <p>Several games in the series are loosely connected through recurring characters and settings</p>
            <p>The 1985 game for Famicom / Nintendo Entertainment System (and Atomic Punk for Game Boy) begins with "Bomberman" (the eponymous character of the game) who worked day in and day out making bombs in an underground compound, but he dreamed of liberty, so he plotted his escape. After hearing a rumor that robots reaching the surface become human, he decides to escape. He was aided by the only skill he knew, bomb making. He uses the bombs to destroy the enemies preventing his escape and to clear blocked walls. When he reaches the surface, he transforms into an organic human being and becomes known as the "Runner". This storyline is not present in some versions, such as Bomberman Party Edition, and this setting was largely abandoned but used for connections with Hudson's Lode Runner games and Bomberman: Act Zero.</p>
            
            <p>The main objective in all games of the series is to complete the stages by placing bombs in strategic orders and locations to destroy obstacles and enemies. When a bomb explodes, it can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detonate other bombs</li>
                <li>Destroy or injure enemies or obstacles</li>
                <li>Destroy the player who placed it or their allies</li>
                <li>Destroy power-up cards</li>
                <li>In some games, damage the "exit," generating more enemies</li>
                <li>Activate/Deactivate a feature of the map (such as a button)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most games in the Bomberman series also feature a Multiplayer mode, where other Bombermen (human or not) can be opponents; the winner is the last one remaining on the map. In other cases (more recent versions), human players can cooperate, with the main objective being to defeat non-human enemies. In this mode, power-up cards are much more numerous and important, as the ones you don't pick up remain available for the enemies.</p>
